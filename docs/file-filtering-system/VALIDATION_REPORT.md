# Validation Report - File Filtering System

## Reality Check Complete

### Verified:
- Node.js environment with TypeScript support exists
- Jest testing framework is available
- Project structure allows for new modules in src/
- No existing file filtering functionality present
- Package.json allows for new dependencies if needed

### Missing:
- File filtering system components (to be created)
- Configuration interfaces
- Glob pattern matching implementation
- Size-based filtering capabilities
- Content-type filtering functionality

### Concerns:
- Need to ensure compatibility with existing TypeScript setup
- Must maintain 100% test coverage as per project standards
- Should follow existing code patterns and conventions
